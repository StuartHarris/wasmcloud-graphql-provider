# `wasmcloud-graphql-provider`

Hosts [PostGraphile](https://graphile.org) as a [wasmCloud](https://wasmcloud.dev) 0.50 capability provider, exposing a postgres database as a GraphQL API for actors to consume.

![architecture](docs/GraphQL%20Provider.svg)

## Getting started

1. build and sign everything

   ```sh
   make
   ```

1. run up a system (postgres DB, pgAdmin, OCI registry, NATS, wasmCloud)

   ```sh
   # install `sqlx-cli` to create db and run migrations
   cargo install sqlx-cli

   # install `zx` to run scripts
   npm install -g zx

   # bring everything up
   cd automation
   ./up.mjs

   # test
   curl -vv -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d@query.json localhost:8080

   # or point GraphQL playground at http://localhost:8080

   ```

1. Some example GraphQL queries:

   ```graphql
   query get_all {
     todos {
       nodes {
         id
         nodeId
         content
         createdAt
         updatedAt
         completedAt
       }
     }
   }

   mutation create_one {
     createTodo(input: { todo: { content: "test" } }) {
       todo {
         id
         nodeId
         content
         createdAt
         updatedAt
         completedAt
       }
     }
   }

   mutation delete_one {
     deleteTodo(input: { id: 1 }) {
       todo {
         id
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Notes

This is a work in progress and not suitable for use anywhere, yet. :-)

The pass-through actor is really just to demo functionality â€” you might instead just consume the GraphQL in your actors, rather than exposing it directly to a browser client.

There may be some an outstanding problem that surfaces when large payloads (like an introspection query) are requested (in addition to the default 1MB limit on NATS).

There is a dev container configuration in the project to build the provider for linux (e.g. if you're on a Mac).

## Todo

- [x] statically linked nodejs to host PostGraphile
- [x] neon bindings to call into PostGraphile middleware
- [x] correlate queries and responses
- [x] Smithy interface
- [x] wasmCloud provider
- [x] package node modules in binary
- [x] pass DATABASE_URL from link through to config
- [x] pass through example actor to demo functionality
- [x] don't block async in handler
- [x] pass HTTP headers through
